# Go API client for recurring

The Recurring APIs allow you to manage and remove your tokens or saved payment details. Tokens should be created with validation during a payment request.

For more information, refer to our [Tokenization documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/checkout/tokenization).
## Authentication
To connect to the Recurring API, you must use your basic authentication credentials. For this, create your web service user, as described in [How to get the WS user password](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-web-service-ws-user-password). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:

```
curl
-U \"ws@Company.YourCompany\":\"YourWsPassword\" \\
-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\
...
```
Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).

## Versioning
Recurring API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.

For example:
```
https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Recurring/v49/disable
```
