# Go API client for platformsnotificationconfiguration

The Notification Configuration API provides endpoints for setting up and testing notifications that inform you of events on your platform, for example when a KYC check or a payout has been completed.

For more information, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/marketpay/marketpay-notifications).
## Authentication
To connect to the Notification Configuration API, you must use basic authentication credentials of your web service user. If you don't have one, contact our [Support Team](https://support.adyen.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:

```
curl
-U \"ws@MarketPlace.YourMarketPlace\":\"YourWsPassword\" \\
-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\
...
```
Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).

## Versioning
The Notification Configuration API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.

For example:
```
https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Notification/v1/createNotificationConfiguration
```
