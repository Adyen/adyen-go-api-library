	// The number of times the transaction (not order) has been retried between different payment service providers. For instance, the `chainAttemptNumber` set to 2 means that this transaction has been recently tried on another provider before being sent to Adyen. > If you submit `retry.chainAttemptNumber`, `retry.orderAttemptNumber`, and `retry.skipRetry` values, we also recommend you provide the `merchantOrderReference` to facilitate linking payment attempts together.
	RetryChainAttemptNumber int32 `json:"retry.chainAttemptNumber,omitempty"`
	// The index of the attempt to bill a particular order, which is identified by the `merchantOrderReference` field. For example, if a recurring transaction fails and is retried one day later, then the order number for these attempts would be 1 and 2, respectively. > If you submit `retry.chainAttemptNumber`, `retry.orderAttemptNumber`, and `retry.skipRetry` values, we also recommend you provide the `merchantOrderReference` to facilitate linking payment attempts together.
	RetryOrderAttemptNumber int32 `json:"retry.orderAttemptNumber,omitempty"`
	// The Boolean value indicating whether Adyen should skip or retry this transaction, if possible. > If you submit `retry.chainAttemptNumber`, `retry.orderAttemptNumber`, and `retry.skipRetry` values, we also recommend you provide the `merchantOrderReference` to facilitate linking payment attempts together.
	RetrySkipRetry bool `json:"retry.skipRetry,omitempty"`
