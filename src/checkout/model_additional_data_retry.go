/*
 * Adyen Checkout API
 *
 * Adyen Checkout API provides a simple and flexible way to initiate and authorise online payments. You can use the same integration for payments made with cards (including 3D Secure), mobile wallets, and local payment methods (for example, iDEAL and Sofort).  This API reference provides information on available endpoints and how to interact with them. To learn more about the API, visit [Checkout documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/checkout).  ## Authentication Each request to the Checkout API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:  ``` curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"X-API-Key: Your_Checkout_API_key\" \\ ... ``` Note that when going live, you need to generate a new API Key to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).  ## Versioning Checkout API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.  For example: ``` https://checkout-test.adyen.com/v65/payments ```

	// The number of times the transaction (not order) has been retried between different payment service providers. For instance, the `chainAttemptNumber` set to 2 means that this transaction has been recently tried on another provider before being sent to Adyen.  > If you submit `retry.chainAttemptNumber`, `retry.orderAttemptNumber`, and `retry.skipRetry` values, we also recommend you provide the `merchantOrderReference` to facilitate linking payment attempts together.
	RetryChainAttemptNumber string `json:"retry.chainAttemptNumber,omitempty"`
	// The index of the attempt to bill a particular order, which is identified by the `merchantOrderReference` field. For example, if a recurring transaction fails and is retried one day later, then the order number for these attempts would be 1 and 2, respectively.  > If you submit `retry.chainAttemptNumber`, `retry.orderAttemptNumber`, and `retry.skipRetry` values, we also recommend you provide the `merchantOrderReference` to facilitate linking payment attempts together.
	RetryOrderAttemptNumber string `json:"retry.orderAttemptNumber,omitempty"`
	// The Boolean value indicating whether Adyen should skip or retry this transaction, if possible.  > If you submit `retry.chainAttemptNumber`, `retry.orderAttemptNumber`, and `retry.skipRetry` values, we also recommend you provide the `merchantOrderReference` to facilitate linking payment attempts together.
	RetrySkipRetry string `json:"retry.skipRetry,omitempty"`
