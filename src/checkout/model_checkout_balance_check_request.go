 * Adyen Checkout API
 *
 * Adyen Checkout API provides a simple and flexible way to initiate and authorise online payments. You can use the same integration for payments made with cards (including 3D Secure), mobile wallets, and local payment methods (for example, iDEAL and Sofort).  This API reference provides information on available endpoints and how to interact with them. To learn more about the API, visit [Checkout documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments).  ## Authentication Each request to the Checkout API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:  ``` curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"X-API-Key: Your_Checkout_API_key\" \\ ... ``` Note that when going live, you need to generate a new API Key to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).  ## Versioning Checkout API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.  For example: ``` https://checkout-test.adyen.com/v69/payments ```  ## Release notes Have a look at the [release notes](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/release-notes?integration_type=api&version=69) to find out what changed in this version!

The same merchant order reference should never be reused after the first authorised attempt. If used, this field should be supplied for all incoming authorisations. > We strongly recommend you send the `merchantOrderReference` value to benefit from linking payment requests when authorisation retries take place. In addition, we recommend you provide `retry.orderAttemptNumber`, `retry.chainAttemptNumber`, and `retry.skipRetry` values in `PaymentRequest.additionalData`.

Any subscription not following a fixed schedule is also considered a card-on-file transaction. * `UnscheduledCardOnFile` – An unscheduled card-on-file (UCoF) transaction is a transaction that occurs on a non-fixed schedule and/or have variable amounts. For example, automatic top-ups when a cardholder's balance drops below a certain amount.

Maximum length: 80 characters.
	Reference string `json:"reference"`
	// Some payment methods require defining a value for this field to specify how to process the transaction.  For the Bancontact payment method, it can be set to: * `maestro` (default), to be processed like a Maestro card, or * `bcmc`, to be processed like a Bancontact card.

	// The shopper's IP address. In general, we recommend that you provide this data, as it is used in a number of risk checks (for instance, number of payment attempts or location-based checks). > For 3D Secure 2 transactions, schemes require `shopperIP` for all browser-based implementations. This field is also mandatory for some merchants depending on your business model. For more information, [contact Support](https://support.adyen.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
	ShopperIP string `json:"shopperIP,omitempty"`

For better authorisation rates, we recommend sending the card security code (CSC) along with the request. * `ContAuth` - Card on file and/or subscription transactions, where the cardholder is known to the merchant (returning customer). If the shopper is present (online), you can supply also the CSC to improve authorisation (one-click payment). * `Moto` - Mail-order and telephone-order transactions where the shopper is in contact with the merchant via email or telephone. * `POS` - Point-of-sale transactions where the shopper is physically present to make a payment using a secure payment terminal.
