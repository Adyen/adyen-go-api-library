 * Adyen Checkout API
 *
 * Adyen Checkout API provides a simple and flexible way to initiate and authorise online payments. You can use the same integration for payments made with cards (including 3D Secure), mobile wallets, and local payment methods (for example, iDEAL and Sofort).  This API reference provides information on available endpoints and how to interact with them. To learn more about the API, visit [online payments documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments).  ## Authentication Each request to Checkout API must be signed with an API key. For this, [get your API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key) from your Customer Area, and set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:  ``` curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\ ... ``` ## Versioning Checkout API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.  For example: ``` https://checkout-test.adyen.com/v70/payments ```  ## Going live  To access the live endpoints, you need an API key from your live Customer Area.  The live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account, for example: ``` https://{PREFIX}-checkout-live.adyenpayments.com/checkout/v70/payments ```  Get your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.  When preparing to do live transactions with Checkout API, follow the [go-live checklist](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/go-live-checklist) to make sure you've got all the required configuration in place.  ## Release notes Have a look at the [release notes](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/release-notes?integration_type=api&version=70) to find out what changed in this version!

// AdditionalDataCommon struct for AdditionalDataCommon
type AdditionalDataCommon struct {
	// Triggers test scenarios that allow to replicate certain communication errors.  Allowed values: * **NO_CONNECTION_AVAILABLE** – There wasn't a connection available to service the outgoing communication. This is a transient, retriable error since no messaging could be initiated to an issuing system (or third-party acquiring system). Therefore, the header Transient-Error: true is returned in the response. A subsequent request using the same idempotency key will be processed as if it was the first request. * **IOEXCEPTION_RECEIVED** – Something went wrong during transmission of the message or receiving the response. This is a classified as non-transient because the message could have been received by the issuing party and been acted upon. No transient error header is returned. If using idempotency, the (error) response is stored as the final result for the idempotency key. Subsequent messages with the same idempotency key not be processed beyond returning the stored response.
	RequestedTestErrorResponseCode string `json:"RequestedTestErrorResponseCode,omitempty"`
	// Flags a card payment request for either pre-authorisation or final authorisation. For more information, refer to [Authorisation types](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/adjust-authorisation#authorisation-types).  Allowed values: * **PreAuth** – flags the payment request to be handled as a pre-authorisation. * **FinalAuth** – flags the payment request to be handled as a final authorisation.
	AuthorisationType string `json:"authorisationType,omitempty"`
	// Allows you to determine or override the acquirer account that should be used for the transaction.  If you need to process a payment with an acquirer different from a default one, you can set up a corresponding configuration on the Adyen payments platform. Then you can pass a custom routing flag in a payment request's additional data to target a specific acquirer.  To enable this functionality, contact [Support](https://www.adyen.help/hc/en-us/requests/new).
	CustomRoutingFlag string `json:"customRoutingFlag,omitempty"`
	// In case of [asynchronous authorisation adjustment](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/adjust-authorisation#adjust-authorisation), this field denotes why the additional payment is made.  Possible values:   * **NoShow**: An incremental charge is carried out because of a no-show for a guaranteed reservation.   * **DelayedCharge**: An incremental charge is carried out to process an additional payment after the original services have been rendered and the respective payment has been processed.
	IndustryUsage string `json:"industryUsage,omitempty"`
	// Allows you to link the transaction to the original or previous one in a subscription/card-on-file chain. This field is required for token-based transactions where Adyen does not tokenize the card.  Transaction identifier from card schemes, for example, Mastercard Trace ID or the Visa Transaction ID.  Submit the original transaction ID of the contract in your payment request if you are not tokenizing card details with Adyen and are making a merchant-initiated transaction (MIT) for subsequent charges.  Make sure you are sending `shopperInteraction` **ContAuth** and `recurringProcessingModel` **Subscription** or **UnscheduledCardOnFile** to ensure that the transaction is classified as MIT.
	NetworkTxReference string `json:"networkTxReference,omitempty"`
	// Boolean indicator that can be optionally used for performing debit transactions on combo cards (for example, combo cards in Brazil). This is not mandatory but we recommend that you set this to true if you want to use the `selectedBrand` value to specify how to process the transaction.
