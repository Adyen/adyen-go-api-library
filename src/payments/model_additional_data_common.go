/*
 * Adyen Payment API
 *
 * A set of API endpoints that allow you to initiate, settle, and modify payments on the Adyen payments platform. You can use the API to accept card payments (including One-Click and 3D Secure), bank transfers, ewallets, and many other payment methods.  To learn more about the API, visit [Classic integration](https://docs.adyen.com/classic-integration).  ## Authentication To connect to the Payments API, you must use your basic authentication credentials. For this, create your web service user, as described in [How to get the WS user password](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-web-service-ws-user-password). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:  ``` curl -U \"ws@Company.YourCompany\":\"YourWsPassword\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ ... ``` Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).  ## Versioning Payments API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.  For example: ``` https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Payment/v64/authorise ```

// AdditionalDataCommon struct for AdditionalDataCommon
type AdditionalDataCommon struct {
	// Triggers test scenarios that allow to replicate certain communication errors.  Allowed values: * **NO_CONNECTION_AVAILABLE** – There wasn't a connection available to service the outgoing communication. This is a transient, retriable error since no messaging could be initiated to an issuing system (or third-party acquiring system). Therefore, the header Transient-Error: true is returned in the response. A subsequent request using the same idempotency key will be processed as if it was the first request. * **IOEXCEPTION_RECEIVED** – Something went wrong during transmission of the message or receiving the response. This is a classified as non-transient because the message could have been received by the issuing party and been acted upon. No transient error header is returned. If using idempotency, the (error) response is stored as the final result for the idempotency key. Subsequent messages with the same idempotency key not be processed beyond returning the stored response.
	RequestedTestErrorResponseCode string `json:"RequestedTestErrorResponseCode,omitempty"`
	// Flags a card payment request for either pre-authorisation or final authorisation. For more information, refer to [Authorisation types](https://docs.adyen.com/checkout/adjust-authorisation#authorisation-types).  Allowed values: * **PreAuth** – flags the payment request to be handled as a pre-authorisation. * **FinalAuth** – flags the payment request to be handled as a final authorisation.
	AuthorisationType string `json:"authorisationType,omitempty"`
	// Allows you to determine or override the acquirer account that should be used for the transaction.  If you need to process a payment with an acquirer different from a default one, you can set up a corresponding configuration on the Adyen payments platform. Then you can pass a custom routing flag in a payment request's additional data to target a specific acquirer.  To enable this functionality, contact [Support](https://support.adyen.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
	CustomRoutingFlag string `json:"customRoutingFlag,omitempty"`
	// In case of [asynchronous authorisation adjustment](https://docs.adyen.com/checkout/adjust-authorisation#adjust-authorisation), this field denotes why the additional payment is made.  Possible values:   * **NoShow**: An incremental charge is carried out because of a no-show for a guaranteed reservation.   * **DelayedCharge**: An incremental charge is carried out to process an additional payment after the original services have been rendered and the respective payment has been processed.
	IndustryUsage string `json:"industryUsage,omitempty"`

Submit the original transaction ID of the contract in your payment request if you are not tokenizing card details with Adyen and are making a merchant-initiated transaction (MIT) for subsequent charges.  Make sure you are sending `shopperInteraction` **ContAuth** and `recurringProcessingModel` **Subscription** or **UnscheduledCardOnFile** to ensure that the transaction is classified as MIT.
	NetworkTxReference string `json:"networkTxReference,omitempty"`
	// Boolean indicator that can be optionally used for performing debit transactions on combo cards (for example, combo cards in Brazil). This is not mandatory but we recommend that you set this to true if you want to use the `selectedBrand` value to specify how to process the transaction.
