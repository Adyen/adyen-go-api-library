/*
 * Adyen Payment API
 *
 * A set of API endpoints that allow you to initiate, settle, and modify payments on the Adyen payments platform. You can use the API to accept card payments (including One-Click and 3D Secure), bank transfers, ewallets, and many other payment methods.  To learn more about the API, visit [Classic integration](https://docs.adyen.com/classic-integration).  ## Authentication To connect to the Payments API, you must use your basic authentication credentials. For this, create your web service user, as described in [How to get the WS user password](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-web-service-ws-user-password). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:  ``` curl -U \"ws@Company.YourCompany\":\"YourWsPassword\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ ... ``` Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).  ## Versioning Payments API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.  For example: ``` https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Payment/v64/authorise ```

// AdditionalData3DSecure struct for AdditionalData3DSecure
type AdditionalData3DSecure struct {
	// Indicates if you are able to process 3D Secure 2 transactions natively on your payment page. Send this parameter when you are using `/payments` endpoint with any of our [native 3D Secure 2 solutions](https://docs.adyen.com/checkout/3d-secure/native-3ds2).   > This parameter only indicates readiness to support native 3D Secure 2 authentication. To specify if you _want_ to perform 3D Secure, use [Dynamic 3D Secure](/risk-management/dynamic-3d-secure) or send the `executeThreeD` parameter.  Possible values: * **true** - Ready to support native 3D Secure 2 authentication. Setting this to true does not mean always applying 3D Secure 2. Adyen still selects the version of 3D Secure based on configuration to optimize authorisation rates and improve the shopper's experience. * **false** – Not ready to support native 3D Secure 2 authentication. Adyen will not offer 3D Secure 2 to your shopper regardless of your configuration. 
	Allow3DS2 string `json:"allow3DS2,omitempty"`
	// Indicates if you want to perform 3D Secure authentication on a transaction.   > Alternatively, you can use [Dynamic 3D Secure](/risk-management/dynamic-3d-secure) to configure rules for applying 3D Secure.  Possible values: * **true** – Perform 3D Secure authentication. * **false** – Don't perform 3D Secure authentication. 
	ExecuteThreeD string `json:"executeThreeD,omitempty"`
	// In case of Secure+, this field must be set to **CUPSecurePlus**.
	MpiImplementationType string `json:"mpiImplementationType,omitempty"`
	// Indicates the [exemption type](https://docs.adyen.com/payments-fundamentals/psd2-sca-compliance-and-implementation-guide#specifypreferenceinyourapirequest) that you want to request for the transaction.   Possible values: * **lowValue**  * **secureCorporate**  * **trustedBeneficiary**  * **transactionRiskAnalysis** 
	ScaExemption string `json:"scaExemption,omitempty"`
	// Indicates your preference for the 3D Secure version.  > If you use this parameter, you override the checks from Adyen's Authentication Engine. We recommend to use this field only if you have an extensive knowledge of 3D Secure.  Possible values: * **1.0.2**: Apply 3D Secure version 1.0.2.  * **2.1.0**: Apply 3D Secure version 2.1.0.  * **2.2.0**: Apply 3D Secure version 2.2.0. If the issuer does not support version 2.2.0, we will fall back to 2.1.0.  The following rules apply: * If you prefer 2.1.0 or 2.2.0 but we receive a negative `transStatus` in the `ARes`, we will apply the fallback policy configured in your account. For example, if the configuration is to fall back to 3D Secure 1, we will apply version 1.0.2. * If you prefer 2.1.0 or 2.2.0 but the BIN is not enrolled, you will receive an error.  
	ThreeDSVersion string `json:"threeDSVersion,omitempty"`
