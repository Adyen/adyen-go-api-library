/*
 * Adyen Payment API
 *
 * A set of API endpoints that allow you to initiate, settle, and modify payments on the Adyen payments platform. You can use the API to accept card payments (including One-Click and 3D Secure), bank transfers, ewallets, and many other payment methods.  To learn more about the API, visit [Classic integration](https://docs.adyen.com/classic-integration).  ## Authentication To connect to the Payments API, you must use your basic authentication credentials. For this, create your web service user, as described in [How to get the WS user password](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-web-service-ws-user-password). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:  ``` curl -U \"ws@Company.YourCompany\":\"YourWsPassword\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ ... ``` Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).  ## Versioning Payments API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.  For example: ``` https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Payment/v64/authorise ```

type AdditionalDataRetry struct {
	// The number of times the transaction (not order) has been retried between different payment service providers. For instance, the `chainAttemptNumber` set to 2 means that this transaction has been recently tried on another provider before being sent to Adyen.  > If you submit `retry.chainAttemptNumber`, `retry.orderAttemptNumber`, and `retry.skipRetry` values, we also recommend you provide the `merchantOrderReference` to facilitate linking payment attempts together.
	RetryChainAttemptNumber string `json:"retry.chainAttemptNumber,omitempty"`
	// The index of the attempt to bill a particular order, which is identified by the `merchantOrderReference` field. For example, if a recurring transaction fails and is retried one day later, then the order number for these attempts would be 1 and 2, respectively.  > If you submit `retry.chainAttemptNumber`, `retry.orderAttemptNumber`, and `retry.skipRetry` values, we also recommend you provide the `merchantOrderReference` to facilitate linking payment attempts together.
	RetryOrderAttemptNumber string `json:"retry.orderAttemptNumber,omitempty"`
	// The Boolean value indicating whether Adyen should skip or retry this transaction, if possible.  > If you submit `retry.chainAttemptNumber`, `retry.orderAttemptNumber`, and `retry.skipRetry` values, we also recommend you provide the `merchantOrderReference` to facilitate linking payment attempts together.
	RetrySkipRetry string `json:"retry.skipRetry,omitempty"`
